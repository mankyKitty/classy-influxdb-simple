Classy InfluxDB Simple
======================

A simple, stupid, classy-mtl style, wrapper for interacting with [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/)
via the HTTP API.

It doesn't do a lot to protect you from yourself, however it does wire in nicely with an application
structured using the Classy Lenses/MTL style. Can/Has/As et al.
